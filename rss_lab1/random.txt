While I weep--while I weep!
Grains of the golden sand--
Them with a tighter clasp?
How few! yet how they creep
O God! can I not save
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not grasp
Is all that we see or seem
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not grasp
You are not wrong, who deem
O God! can I not save
Through my fingers to the deep,
But a dream within a dream?Is but a dream within a dream.
One from the pitiless wave?
I stand amid the roar
Is it therefore the less gone?
