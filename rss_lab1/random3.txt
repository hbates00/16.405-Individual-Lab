Grains of the golden sand--
And, in parting from you now,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Grains of the golden sand--
In a vision, or in none,
Is but a dream within a dream.
All that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?
That my days have been a dream;
You are not wrong, who deem
Grains of the golden sand--
That my days have been a dream;
Is but a dream within a dream.
O God! can I not save
